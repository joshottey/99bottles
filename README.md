# Ruby coding exercises from Chris Pine's book, Learn to Program

<b>99bottles</b>
<br>
A variation on the 99 Bottles of Beer exercise in Chris Pine's Learn to Program (Ruby).
This version asks if you want to buy more beer after the first go. If you respond with 'ok' you'll be asked how many bottles you want to buy. The song will sing thru again for the number of bottles you enter.
